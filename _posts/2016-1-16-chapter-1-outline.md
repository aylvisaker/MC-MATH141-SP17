# Section 1.1 - Introduction
* Natural numbers
* Integers
* Rational numbers
* Irrational numbers
* Real numbers

# Section 1.2 - The Real Line
* Coordinate line
* Inequality rules
	* Either $a<b$, or $b<a$, or $a=b$
	* If $a>b$, then $a+c>b+c$
	* If $a>b$ and $c>0$, then $ac>bc$
	* If $a>b$ and $c<0$, then $ac<bc$
* Intervals
	* Set builder notation: $\{x\mid a<x<b\}$
	* Open intervals
	* Closed intervals
	* Unbounded intervals
	* Graphical representation
* Sign charts
* Union and intersection
* Absolute value
* Distance on the real line (1D)
* Midpoints on the real line (1D)
* Absolute value properties
	* $\vert ab\vert = \vert a\vert \cdot \vert b\vert$
	* $\left\vert \vert a\vert - \vert b\vert \right\vert \leq \vert a + b\vert \leq \vert a\vert + \vert b\vert$
	* $\vert x\vert < a$ if and only if $-a<x<a$
	* $\vert x\vert > a$ if and only if $x<-a$ or $x>a$

# Section 1.3 - The Coordinate Plane
* Coordinate plane (i.e. Cartesian plane or $xy$-plane)
	* Origin
	* $x$-axis
	* $y$-axis
	* Ordered pair (not to be confused with an interval)
	* Quadrants
* Distance formula in the plane (2D)
* Midpoint formula in the plane (2D)
* Standard form of a circle
* Completing the square

# Section 1.4 - Equations and Graphs
* Equation
	* Identity
	* Conditional equation
* Graph of an equation
* $x$-intercept and $y$-intercept (collectively known as axis intercepts)
* Symmetry
	* $x$-axis
	* $y$-axis
	* origin

# Section 1.5 - Using Technology to Graph Equations
* Viewing rectangle

# Section 1.6 - Functions
* Function / functional relationship
	* Independent variable
	* Dependent variable
* Domain and range
* Box notation
* Vertical line test
* Finding domain and range from a graph
* Piecewise defined functions
* Difference quotient
* Average rate of change
* Instantaneous rate of change
* Range is not always *possible* to find precisely
* Odd and even and neither functions
	* Even functions have graphs with $y$-axis symmetry. Analytic test: $f(-x)=f(x)$.
	* Odd functions have graphs with origin symmetry. Analytic test: $f(-x)=-f(x)$.
	* Functions do not need to be even or odd. For example $f(x)=x+1$ is neither.
* Local maximums and local minimums
