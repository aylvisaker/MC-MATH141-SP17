# Section 1.1 - Introduction
* Natural numbers
* Integers
* Rational numbers
* Irrational numbers
* Real numbers

# Section 1.2 - The Real Line
* Coordinate line
* Inequality rules
	* Either $a<b$, or $b<a$, or $a=b$
	* If $a>b$, then $a+c>b+c$
	* If $a>b$ and $c>0$, then $ac>bc$
	* If $a>b$ and $c<0$, then $ac<bc$
* Example 1: Solve $2x-1<4x+3$.
* Example 2: Solve $-1<2x+3<5$.
* Intervals
	* Set builder notation: $\{x\mid a<x<b\}$
	* Open intervals
	* Closed intervals
	* Unbounded intervals
	* Graphical representation
* Example 3:
	* Express the interval $[-3,2)$ using inequalities.
	* Express the inequality $-\infty<x\leq 2$ using interval notation.
* Sign charts
* Example 4: Solve $(x-1)(x-3)>0$.
* Example 5: Solve $x^2-4x+3>0$.
* Union and intersection
* Example 6: Solve $(x-1)(x-3)(5-x)\leq 0$.
* Example 7: Solve $\frac{x^2-4}{x(4-x)}\geq 0$.
* Absolute value
* Example 8: Solve $\left\vert\frac{x-2}{2x+1}\right\vert = 3$.
* Distance on the real line (1D)
* Midpoints on the real line (1D)
* Absolute value properties
	* $\vert ab\vert = \vert a\vert \cdot \vert b\vert$
	* $\left\vert \vert a\vert - \vert b\vert \right\vert \leq \vert a + b\vert \leq \vert a\vert + \vert b\vert$
	* $\vert x\vert < a$ if and only if $-a<x<a$
	* $\vert x\vert > a$ if and only if $x<-a$ or $x>a$
* Example 9: Solve $\vert 2x-1\vert < 3$.
* Example 10: Solve $\vert -3x+2\vert > 8$.
* Example 11: When a charity conducts a fundraising campaign, it is common to describe the progress with respect to the midpoint value (half the goal). Let $R$ be the amount a charity wants to raise, and $A$ be the amount already raised. Find an expression (in terms of $A$ and $R$) for the amount over / under the midpoint value.

# Section 1.3 - The Coordinate Plane
* Coordinate plane (i.e. Cartesian plane or $xy$-plane)
	* Origin
	* $x$-axis
	* $y$-axis
	* Ordered pair (not to be confused with an interval)
	* Quadrants
* Example 1: Sketch the points associated with ordered pairs: $(1,2)$, $(-1,3)$, $(-2,-\pi)$, and $(\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{3})$.
* Example 2: Sketch the points that satisfy both $x>2$ and $y\leq 1$.
* Example 3: Sketch the points that satisfy both $1\leq \vert x\vert\leq 2$ and $-1<y<3$
* Distance formula in the plane (2D)
* Midpoint formula in the plane (2D)
* Standard form of a circle
* Example 4: Determine an equation for a circle of radius $3$, centered at $(-1,2)$.
* Example 5: Sketch the points that satisfy $1<(x-2)^2+(y-1)^2\leq 4$.
* Example 6: Find the equation of the circle with center $(-2,-1)$ that passes through the point $(-3,1)$.
* Completing the square
* Example 7: Sketch the circle with equation $x^2 + y^2 + 4x - 6y = 3$.
* Example 8: A gas pipeline is to be constructed from point $A$ to point $B$ on the other side of a river. Point $C$ is constructed directly across the river from point $B$. Point $A$ is located on the same side as point $C$, but $300$ feet upstream. If the river is $750$ feet wide, how much pipe is required?

# Section 1.4 - Equations and Graphs
* Equation
	* Identity
	* Conditional equation
* Example 1: Solve the conditional equation.
	* $x^2-5x-6=0$
	* $\frac{x-3}{x^2+x+1}=0$
	* $\frac{1}{x+1}+1=\frac{1}{x^2-x-2}$
	* $\sqrt{x-6}+\sqrt{x-1}=5$
* Graph of an equation
* Example 2: Sketch the graph of $2x+3y=6$
* $x$-intercept and $y$-intercept (collectively known as axis intercepts)
* Example 3: Sketch the graph of $y=\frac{x^2+x-2}{x-1}$
* Example 4: Sketch the graph of each equation.
	* $y=x^2$
	* $x=y^2$
	* $x^2+y^2=1$
* Example 5: Use the graph of $x=y^2$ to graph $y=\sqrt{x}$.
* Symmetry
	* $x$-axis
	* $y$-axis
	* origin
* Example 6: Use symmetry to graph $y=\vert x\vert$.
* Example 7: Determine any symmetry of $y=x^3$.
* Example 8: A homeowner wants to create a garden surrounded by a brick border. The plot in which the garden (and its border) are to be contained is $384$ square feet in area and is twice as long as it is wide. The brick border is $4$ feet wide on all sides.
	* Find the dimensions of the garden.
	* Estimate the number of 10 inch by 4 inch bricks required for the border.
