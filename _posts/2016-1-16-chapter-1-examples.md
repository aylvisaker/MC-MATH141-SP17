* Example 11: When a charity conducts a fundraising campaign, it is common to describe the progress with respect to the midpoint value (half the goal). Let $R$ be the amount a charity wants to raise, and $A$ be the amount already raised. Find an expression (in terms of $A$ and $R$) for the amount over / under the midpoint value.

# Section 1.3 - The Coordinate Plane

* Example 7: Sketch the circle with equation $x^2 + y^2 + 4x - 6y = 3$.
* Example 8: A gas pipeline is to be constructed from point $A$ to point $B$ on the other side of a river. Point $C$ is constructed directly across the river from point $B$. Point $A$ is located on the same side as point $C$, but $300$ feet upstream. If the river is $750$ feet wide, how much pipe is required?

# Section 1.4 - Equations and Graphs
* Example 1: Solve the conditional equation.
	* $x^2-5x-6=0$
	* $\frac{x-3}{x^2+x+1}=0$
	* $\frac{1}{x+1}+1=\frac{1}{x^2-x-2}$

	* $x=y^2$
	* $x^2+y^2=1$
* Example 5: Use the graph of $x=y^2$ to graph $y=\sqrt{x}$.
* Example 6: Use symmetry to graph $y=\vert x\vert$.
* Example 7: Determine any symmetry of $y=x^3$.
* Example 8: A homeowner wants to create a garden surrounded by a brick border. The plot in which the garden (and its border) are to be contained is $384$ square feet in area and is twice as long as it is wide. The brick border is $4$ feet wide on all sides.
	* Find the dimensions of the garden.
	* Estimate the number of 10 inch by 4 inch bricks required for the border.

# Section 1.5 - Using Technology to Graph Equations
* Example 1: Sketch the graph of $y=x^2+5$ in the following viewing rectangles. Which is the most appropriate?
	* $[-3,3]\times[-3,3]$
	* $[-6,6]\times[-6,6]$
	* $[-10,10]\times[-3,30]$
	* $[-50,50]\times[0,1000]$
* Example 2: Sketch the graph of $x^3-25x$
* Example 3: Sketch the graph of $y=kx$ for $k=\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\pm\frac12,\pm\frac13$, and discuss the effect of the constant $k$ on the graph.
* Example 4: Sketch the graph of $y=x$ in the viewing rectangle $[-3,3]\times[-3,3]$, then sketch the graph of $y=2x$ in the viewing rectangle $[-3,3]\times[-6,6]$.
* Example 5: Sketch the graph of $y=x^3+kx$ for several values of $k$ and describe the effect of $k$ on the curve.

# Section 1.6 - Functions
* Example 1: Use the graph of $y=\sqrt{x}+1$ to find the domain of the function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}+1$.
* Example 2: Evaluate $f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1$ at the given values.
	* $2$
	* $\sqrt{5}$
	* $-1+\sqrt{2}$
	* $2w+1$
* Example 3: Find the domain and range of the function described by $f(x)=\begin{cases}x-1 & -3\leq x<0\\ x^2 & 0\leq x\leq 2\end{cases}$.
* Example 4: Consider the function $f$ described by $f(x)=x^2+x$. Determine, for arbitrary $x$ and $h\neq0$, simplified expressions for each of the following.
	* $f(x+h)$
	* $f(x+h)-f(x)$
	* $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$
* Example 5: Let $f(x)=\frac{1}{x-1} + 2$.
	* Find the domain of $f$.
	* Find a value of $x$ for which $f(x)=5$.
* Example 6: Find the domain of each function.
	* $f(x) = x^2-4x+3$
	* $g(x) = \frac{1}{x^2-4x+3}$
	* $h(x) = \sqrt{x^2-4x+3}$
	* $k(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-4x+3}}$
* Example 7: Use the graph of the function $f(x)=\frac{x^2+4}{x^2-4}$ to determine its range.
	* Even functions have graphs with $y$-axis symmetry. Analytic test: $f(-x)=f(x)$.
	* Odd functions have graphs with origin symmetry. Analytic test: $f(-x)=-f(x)$.
	* Functions do not need to be even or odd. For example $f(x)=x+1$ is neither.
* Example 8: Two ships sail from the same port. The first leaves at 1:00 AM and travels eastward at $15$ knots (nautical miles per hour). The second ship leaves port at 2:00 AM and travels northward at $10$ knots. Find the distance between the ships as a function of time after 2:00 AM.
* Example 9: A box without a top is to be constructed from a square piece of cardboard with sides of length $3$ feet. Construction will proceed by cutting small squares out of each corner of the cardboard and then bending up the flaps. Approximate the size of the square that should be removed from each corner in order to obtain the maximum volume.
