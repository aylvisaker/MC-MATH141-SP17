You should try doing the "easy" problems after reading each section and bring questions to class.Try the "hard" problems after discussing each section in class. Exams questions will be selected from both groups. Unless otherwise specified, ranges are meant to include only odd problems. Each "extra credit" problem can be submitted for one point on your next exam. Extra credit problems will not be accepted on or after the date of the exam for that section.
