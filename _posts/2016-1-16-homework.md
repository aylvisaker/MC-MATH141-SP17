You should try doing the "easy" problems after reading each section and bring questions to class. Try the "hard" problems after discussing each section in class. Exams questions will be selected from both of these. The problems in each section are broken up into groups. At a minimum you should make sure that you can successfully complete at least one problem from each group. Each "extra credit" problem can be submitted for one point on your next exam. Extra credit problems will not be accepted on or after the date of the exam for that section.

Unless otherwise specified, ranges are meant to include only the odd numbered problems.
