# Course Schedule / Content
A detailed schedule can be found on the course webpage. This will be kept up to date as the semester progresses. We have a total of 69 class days scheduled. Of those, 9 have been allotted for exams. We will require at least 47 days for class discussinos. This leaves 13 flex days. Flex days can be used at any time for any reason as long as it is approved by a simple majority of students who are present. You may want to use one for a review day before an exam, or to spend some extra time discussing a difficult section in the book.
* Chapter 1 : Algebra review and introduction to functions
* Chapter 2 : Combining functions with operations
* Chapter 3 : Algebraic functions
* Chapter 4 : Trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions

# Grading
Your overall grade for the course will follow the standard 90/80/70/60 scale. With 90 sufficient for some kind of A, 80 sufficient for some kind of B, etc. Plus and minus grades will be assigned at the instructor's discretion, typically the lower third of the range (0-3) earning a minus and the upper third of the range (7 and up) earning a plus.

# Final Exam
The final exam will be cumulative and takes place on Saturday, December 10 at 11:30 AM in CSB 309. This exam cannot be rescheduled except under extreme circumstances.

# Workload Expectations
In addition to attending class each day, students should plan to spend approximately 10 hours per week working outside of class. This time should be used reading, completing assigned homework, studying, and making use of available resources. This gure is nothing more than an estimated average, some students may need to spend much more than 10 hours practicing in order to learn the material eectively.

# Calculators
In class we will make use of both calculators and computer software to help illuminate and solidify concepts. Students should plan to bring a graphing calculator each day. The recommended model is the TI-84 (any version will do).

# Cellular Telephones
Cellular telephone use is not allowed in this class. It is distracting, disruptive, and downright rude. Phones should be silenced before class begins and kept put away while class is in session. If you must have your phone on due to an imminent emergency, it should be kept on vibrate and you should quietly leave the room to answer any calls or texts. If you are caught using a your phone in class, you will be asked to leave of your own accord or be escorted out by campus security. Please don't make this an issue.

# Academic Dishonesty
In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an F or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the students course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of F and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations.

# Disability Accomodations
Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis by considering the disability documentation provided by the student, the functional impact of the students disability, and the essential requirements of the students courses, programs, and activities. Disability Services works in conjunction with faculty to determine appropriate accommodations for students in their courses. Please contact Disability Services at the Teaching and Learning Center, 2nd oor Poling Hall, 309-457-2257, or tlc@monmouthcollege.edu with specic disability or accommodation related questions.
